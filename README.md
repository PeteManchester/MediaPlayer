# MediaPlayer - Java Based Open Home UPnP Media Renderer

A fully open-source java project that uses the [OpenHome API](http://www.openhome.org/wiki/Oh:Overview) to
implement a UPNP Media Renderer.

## Features

MediaPlayer provides a large support of OpenHome specific devices as well as
standard UPnP devices.

To playback Media files, [mplayer](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/)
as well as [mpd](http://www.musicpd.org/) is used (based on your choice, this is
[configurable](https://github.com/PeteManchester/MediaPlayer/wiki/MediaPlayer-Options)).

The combination of OpenHome as well as mpd does allow MediaPlayer to provide gapless
playback (yes, gapless, for beneath 0€ ;-)).

We support the following UPnP and OpenHome Functionality:

* [PlayLists](http://www.openhome.org/wiki/Av:Developer:PlaylistService)
* [Radio](http://www.openhome.org/wiki/Av:Developer:RadioService)
* [SongCast](http://www.linn.co.uk/software#songcast)

We are currently implementing a http-daemon to make it possible to configure and
control the whole application via a web-interface.

The MediaPlayer is easily extentable via [Plugins](https://github.com/PeteManchester/MediaPlayer/wiki).
Right now, we have the following Plugins:

* [AlarmClock](https://github.com/PeteManchester/MediaPlayer/wiki/Plugins-AlarmClock)
* [LastFM](https://github.com/PeteManchester/MediaPlayer/wiki/Plugins-LastFM)
* [LCDDisplay](https://github.com/PeteManchester/MediaPlayer/wiki/Plugins-Display)
* [Fullscreen](https://github.com/PeteManchester/MediaPlayer/wiki/Plugins-Fullscreen)
* [LIRCIntegration](https://github.com/PeteManchester/MediaPlayer/wiki/Plugins-LIRCIntegration)

## Installation Instructions

* [Raspberry Pi / Debian](https://github.com/PeteManchester/MediaPlayer/wiki/Install-Raspberry-Pi)
* [Raspberry Pi / ArchLinux](/docs/archlinux-setup.html)
* [Fullscreen Plugin / ArchLinux](/docs/fullscreen-setup.html)
