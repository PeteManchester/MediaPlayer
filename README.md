# MediaPlayer - Java Based Open Home UPnP Media Renderer

A fully open-source java project that uses the [OpenHome API](http://www.openhome.org/wiki/Oh:Overview) to
implement a UPNP Media Renderer.

The MediaPlayer is Java based and so will work on a wide range of hardware and Operating Systems without the need to provide different install packages or recompile the code.  

## Features

MediaPlayer provides a large support of OpenHome specific devices as well as
standard UPnP devices.

To playback Media files, [mplayer](http://www.mplayerhq.hu/)
as well as [mpd](http://www.musicpd.org/) is used (based on your choice, this is
[configurable](https://github.com/PeteManchester/MediaPlayer/wiki/MediaPlayer-Options)).

The combination of OpenHome as well as mpd does allow MediaPlayer to provide gapless
playback (yes, gapless, for beneath 0â‚¬ ;-)).

We support the following UPnP and OpenHome Functionality:

* [PlayLists](http://www.openhome.org/wiki/Av:Developer:PlaylistService)
* [Radio](http://www.openhome.org/wiki/Av:Developer:RadioService)
* [SongCast (Receiver)](http://www.linn.co.uk/software#songcast)

Also supported is an Apple AirPlay receiver, and the ability to create custom input sources which are selected from your control point.

We have implemented a http-daemon to make it possible to:  

* Configure and control the whole application via a web-interface. 
* View the last 50 log events.
* Display info about the currently playing track, providing info such as lyrics and info about the artist.
* And if using the AlarmClock plugin you can also set a sleep timer from the web page.

* [Fullscreen](https://github.com/PeteManchester/MediaPlayer/wiki/Plugins-Fullscreen)
* [LIRCIntegration](https://github.com/PeteManchester/MediaPlayer/wiki/Plugins-LIRCIntegration)
* [LCDDisplay](https://github.com/PeteManchester/MediaPlayer/wiki/Plugins-Display)

If you appreciate the Java MediaPlayer please support:

[Linn] (http://www.linn.co.uk/) Who produce top end Audio equipment whilst providing OpenSource Software. They also have their own record label. 

[OpenHome] (http://www.openhome.org/wiki/OhNet) Who provide the ohNet API on which this MediaPlayer is based and who have provided great support whilst I have been developing the MediaPlayer.
