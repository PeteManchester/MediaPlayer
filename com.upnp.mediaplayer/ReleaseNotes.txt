Fixed bugs with volume and mute when starting playing tracks.
5th August 2013 v0.0.0.3 
Changed Previous Track control to restart same track if the play time is greater than 3 seconds, if less than 3 seconds the previous track is started
Added default path the mplayer on a raspi, so that mediaplayer should still work if the app.properties file is not present
30th Sept 2013 v0.0.0.4
Added support for the MPD player, which can provide gapless playback
Added a check for 'AUDIO/X-MPEGURL' for unknown url types
Added config options enableAVTransport and enableReceiver to add support for more Control Points
12 November 2013
Added InputSources.xml for configuring sources, added to main code and there is a plugin for controlling GPIO pins.
Now added pi4j to main app, but only initiated if running on a Raspi, needs to be in the mediaplayer_lib, this allows mutliple plugins to share the same GPIO object
28 November 2013
Fixed issue with the Volume value when a USB DAC does not support hardware volume
Fixed issue when shutting down if Pi4J had not be initialized
2 December 2013
Changed the way the volume is handled for USB DAC that does not support hardware volume control, now we keep the -1 value internally and return zero to the control point, but if the volume is less than zero we do not set the volue or mute
Added logic to ignore a play request if it is recieved within 1 second after a seekid or seekindex request, some control points just send a seekId or seekIndex request to play a track, others send a seekId or seekIndex immediately followed by a Play request
24 December 2013
Fixed but with LCDDisplay, I now set the standby status when creating the scroller
30 December 2013
Fixed PlayList bug with BubbleUPnP, now on ReadList we only return the tracks requested by the CP, instead of all tracks.
5 January 2013
Added 'icy_reverse' attribute to RadioList.xml, allows ICY title and artist to be reversed.
23 January OSManager changes, we now require readelf to be intalled on Linux OS, if this is not installed on ArchLinux install 'binutils'
24 January Added the images directory back into the .jar file
16 Feb - Added TripleMs LastFM Scrobbler, with added blacklist to hide your guilty secrets..
